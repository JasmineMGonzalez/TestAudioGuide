Where are you from?  
Consider all the living things on Earth. Each one comes from the molten hearts of ancient stars.  

As a human being, you are part of a vast wave of energy that began with the explosion that created our universe.  

The Big Bang formed stars. Some stars became planets.  

One planet (we know of) grew life.  

Hedgehogs, sharks, bats, oak trees, peacocks, molluscs. Shrimp in their billions, ants in their trillions, fungi in their quadrillions. And you. Your lungs, your heart, your blood and brain are all made of star-stuff.  

Welcome to the universe... where the stars have aligned to bring us from the Big Bang to Bradford.  

> “We are progeny of this cosmos and our ability to understand it is an inheritance.”
